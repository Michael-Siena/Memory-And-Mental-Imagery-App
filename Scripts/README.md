# Object-and-Spatial-Memory-Task
This task was used in research investigating objective and subjective aspects of episodic memory in aphantasic individuals, who report mental imagery deficits (for preprint, see https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gx4yw). To summarise, the task involves learning the randomly varying colour hue and location of several objects presented within a 3D virtual environment. These objects are viewed from either a first or third person perspective. Following a brief delay period, participants then rate their subjective memory vividness and attempt to precisely reproduce each studied object feature from either the same or alternate study perspective. 

This task was run in browser as a Unity WebGL application, hosted on a private Github Pages site, with anonymised data being collected and stored in a secure Google FireBase realtime database.

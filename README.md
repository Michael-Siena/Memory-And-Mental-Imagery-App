# Object-and-Spatial-Memory-Task
This task was used in research investigating objective and subjective aspects of episodic (i.e., personal) memory in aphantasic individuals, who report mental imagery and memory difficulties. Note that the code and materials are intentionally left incomplete as they relate 
to a yet-to-be published research study (for preprint, see https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gx4yw). Additionally, this task was built as a Unity WebGL application, hosted on a private Github Pages site, with data sent to a secure Google FireBase realtime database. 

To summarise, the task involves learning the randomly varying colour hue and location of sequentially presented common objects. These objects are viewed within a 3D virtual environment from either a first or third person perspective. 
In the subsequent test phase, you are instructed to rate your memory vividness for the colour hue and location for each studied object as well as attempt to precisely reproduce these features from the same or alternative study perspective.

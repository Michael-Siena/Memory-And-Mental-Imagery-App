Aphantasic individuals commonly report poor mental imagery and memory abilities, yet few studies on aphantasia have objectively tested these abilities together in an experiment. Therefore, I designed this 
data collection app to measure how well individuals with a condition called aphantasia could remember the location and colour of common objects seen within a 3D virtual environment.


To give a brief overview of the most important aspects of the app (see figure 1), research participants initially familiarised themselves with the testing environment during the exploration phase
(not shown). A) Then, in the study phase, participants learned the colour and location of eight target
objects. These target objects were presented in a series at random locations in the testing
environment, which were viewed from either a first-person (left) or third-person (right) perspective.
After the study phase, participants solved simple self-paced arithmetic problems for 30s (not shown).
B) Finally, in the test phase, studied target objects were first cued in greyscale (top) before
participants made subjective memory imagery vividness ratings on (not shown), then reproduced,
their object (middle) and spatial memory features, the latter of which were tested in the same or
alternative studied perspective (bottom left or right). Vividness ratings always preceded feature
reproduction, but object and spatial memory assessment order randomly varied. Note that target
object size has been increased for clarity in this figure.

In addition to measuring all-or-none memory accuracy, I measured how precisely aphantasics could remember object subtly varying colour hues (example given below in figure 2) to gain gain more detailed insight 
into how their self-reported lack of mental imagery affected their objective memory abilities.

**Figure 2. An example target object stimulus, colour-rotated in 60Â° increments.** 
Note that colour hue was allowed to vary continuously during the actual experiment.

Subsequent statistical analysis on data collected from this app revealed that aphantasics can remember colour hues as precisely as non-aphantasic individuals - a surprising finding given their self-reported inability to 
visualise object properties. This work suggests that some aphantasics may retain high-fidelty visual memory reprsentations that may not be consciously accessible.

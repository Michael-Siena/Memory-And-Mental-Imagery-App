# Object-and-Spatial-Memory-Task
This task was used in research investigating objective and subjective aspects of episodic (i.e., personal) memory in aphantasic individuals, who report mental imagery and memory difficulties (for preprint, see https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gx4yw). To summarise, the task involves learning the randomly varying colour hue and location of sequentially presented objects within a 3D virtual environment. These objects are viewed from either a first or third person perspective. In the subsequent test phase, you are instructed to rate your memory vividness for the colour hue and location for each studied object as well as attempt to precisely reproduce these features from the same or alternative study perspective. 

This task was run in browser as a Unity WebGL application, hosted on a private Github Pages site, with anonymised data being collected and stored in a secure Google FireBase realtime database. Note that the code and materials in this repository are intentionally left incomplete as they relate to a yet-to-be published research study.

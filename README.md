Individuals with [aphantasia](https://aphantasia.com/what-is-aphantasia/) commonly report poor mental imagery and memory abilities, yet few studies have objectively tested these abilities together in an experiment. Therefore, I built this data collection app to 
go beyond questionnaire-based self-reports and measure how well aphantasics could remember the location and colour of common objects seen within a 3D virtual environment (see Figure 1 for overview). Critically, I varied object colour hues along the [CIELAB](https://www.hunterlab.com/blog/what-is-cielab-color-space/)
percetually uniform colour space and used [model-based measures of memory fidelity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2588137/) (in addition to all-or-none memory accuracy) in order to gain detailed insight into aphantasic memory representations.

<small>**Figure 1. Schematic representation of a testing block in the memory and mental imagery data collection app.**
First, research participants initially familiarised themselves with the testing environment during the exploration phase (not shown). A) Then, in the study phase, participants learned the colour and location 
of eight target objects. These target objects were presented in a series at random locations in the testing environment, which were viewed from either a first-person (left) or third-person (right) perspective. 
After the study phase, participants solved simple self-paced arithmetic problems for 30s (not shown). B) Finally, in the test phase, studied target objects were first cued in greyscale (top) before participants 
made subjective memory imagery vividness ratings on (not shown), then reproduced, their object (middle) and spatial memory features, the latter of which were tested in the same or alternative studied perspective 
(bottom left or right).</small>

Subsequent statistical analysis on data collected from this app found no objective memory differences between aphantasics and control participants, including colour memory precision - a surprising finding given their self-reported lack of mental imagery experience. [This work](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_02120/119441/Metacognitive-Awareness-and-the-Subjective?redirectedFrom=fulltext) suggests that some aphantasics may retain and unconsciously utilise high-fidelty visual memory reprsentations. In other words, some aphantasics may lack awareness of their
mental imagery rather than lack mental imagery altogether.

Individuals with [aphantasia](https://aphantasia.com/what-is-aphantasia/) commonly self-report poor visual mental imagery and memory abilities, yet few studies have objectively tested these abilities together in an experiment. Therefore, I built this app to go beyond questionnaire-based self-reports and measure how well aphantasics could actually remember visual (i.e., object colour) and spatial (i.e., object location) memory features studied within 3D virtual environments (see Figure 1 for overview). Critically, I varied object colour hues along the [CIELAB](https://www.hunterlab.com/blog/what-is-cielab-color-space/) percetually uniform colour space and used [model-based measures of memory precision](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2588137/) in order to test the _fidelity_ of visual memory representations on top of whether memory features were simply remembered or not. This subtler approach should be more capable of detecting true aphantasia-related visual mental imagery deficits, which may otherwise be compensated for using non-imagery-based memory strategies (e.g., recalling verbal colour labels rather than bringing to mind the colour itself).

<small>**Figure 1. Schematic representation of a testing block in the memory and mental imagery data collection app.**
First, research participants initially familiarised themselves with the testing environment during the exploration phase (not shown). A) Then, in the study phase, participants learned the colour and location 
of eight target objects. These target objects were presented at random locations in the testing environment and viewed from either a first-person (top left) or third-person (top right) perspective. 
After the study phase, participants solved simple self-paced arithmetic problems for 30s (not shown). B) Finally, in the test phase, studied target objects were first cued in greyscale (top) before participants 
made subjective memory imagery vividness ratings (not shown) and then reproduced the studied object (middle) and spatial memory features (bottom).</small>

Subsequent [statistical analysis](https://github.com/Michael-Siena/Aphantasia-Study-Analysis) of data collected from this app, however, found no significant objective memory differences between aphantasics and control participants, including in colour memory recall precision (for main findings, see Figure 2 B, left) - a surprising finding given their self-reported lack of visual mental imagery experience. [This work](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_02120/119441/Metacognitive-Awareness-and-the-Subjective?redirectedFrom=fulltext) suggests that some aphantasics may retain and unconsciously utilise high-fidelty visual memory reprsentations. In other words, some aphantasics may lack awareness of their
mental imagery rather than lack mental imagery altogether.

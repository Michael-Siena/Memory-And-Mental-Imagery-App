This app collected behavioural data measuring how well research participants could remember the location and colour of common objects seen within a 3D virtual environment.

Figure 1 provides a schematic overview of the most important parts of the app.

**Figure 1. Schematic representation of a testing block in the memory and mental imagery data collection app.**
Participants initially familiarised themselves with the testing environment during the exploration phase
(not shown). A) Then, in the study phase, participants learned the colour and location of eight target
objects. These target objects were presented in a series at random locations in the testing
environment, which were viewed from either a first-person (left) or third-person (right) perspective.
After the study phase, participants solved simple self-paced arithmetic problems for 30s (not shown).
B) Finally, in the test phase, studied target objects were first cued in greyscale (top) before
participants made subjective memory imagery vividness ratings on (not shown), then reproduced,
their object (middle) and spatial memory features, the latter of which were tested in the same or
alternative studied perspective (bottom left or right). Vividness ratings always preceded feature
reproduction, but object and spatial memory assessment order randomly varied. Note that target
object size has been increased for clarity in this figure.

By subtly varying the colour hue of objects within a perceptually uniform colourspace (example below), I examined the _fidelity_ of memory in addition to all-or-none accuracy to gain detailed insights into a condition called aphantasia, where individuals report difficulty visualising objects in their mind.

was allowed to vary continuously during the actual experiment.

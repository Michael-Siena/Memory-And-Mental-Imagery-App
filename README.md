Individuals aphantasia commonly report poor mental imagery and memory abilities, yet few studies have objectively tested these abilities together in an experiment despite their subjective complaints. Therefore, 
I built this data collection app to measure how well aphantasics could remember the location and colour of common objects seen within a 3D virtual environment (see figure 1 for overview). Critically, I used
model-based measures of memory fidelity or _precision_ as well as all-or-none memory accuracy in order to gain detailed insight into their memory representations.

**Figure 1. Schematic representation of a testing block in the memory and mental imagery data collection app.**
First, research participants initially familiarised themselves with the testing environment during the exploration phase (not shown). A) Then, in the study phase, participants learned the colour and location 
of eight target objects. These target objects were presented in a series at random locations in the testing environment, which were viewed from either a first-person (left) or third-person (right) perspective. 
After the study phase, participants solved simple self-paced arithmetic problems for 30s (not shown). B) Finally, in the test phase, studied target objects were first cued in greyscale (top) before participants 
made subjective memory imagery vividness ratings on (not shown), then reproduced, their object (middle) and spatial memory features, the latter of which were tested in the same or alternative studied perspective 
(bottom left or right). Vividness ratings always preceded feature reproduction, but object and spatial memory assessment order randomly varied. Note that target object size has been increased for clarity in this 
figure.

Subsequent statistical analysis on data collected from this app revealed that aphantasics can remember colour hues as precisely as non-aphantasic individuals - a surprising finding given their self-reported inability 
to visualise object properties. This work suggests that some aphantasics may retain high-fidelty visual memory reprsentations that may not be consciously accessible.

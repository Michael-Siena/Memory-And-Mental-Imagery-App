# Object-and-Spatial-Memory-Task
This task was used in research investigating objective and subjective aspects of episodic (i.e., personal) memory in aphantasic individuals, who report mental imagery and memory difficulties. Note that the code and materials are intentionally left incomplete as they relate 
to a yet-to-be published research study (for preprint, see https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gx4yw). Additionally, this task was built as a Unity WebGL application, hosted on a private Github Pages site, with data sent to a secure Google FireBase realtime database. 

To summarise, the task first involved learning the randomly varying colour hue and location of sequentially presented common objects. These objects were viewed within a 3D virtual environment from either a first or third person perspective. 
In the subsequent test phase, participants are asked to rate the vividness of their memory for these studied object (i.e., colour hue) and spatial (i.e., location) memory features as well as attempt to precisely reproduce them from the same or alternative study perspective.
